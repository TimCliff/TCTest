# General

## What is Steemit.com?

Steemit is a social network that empowers people for their contributions by rewarding them for their time, effort and creativity through digital points called Steem.

Steemit has redefined social media by building a living, breathing, growing social economy; a “small town” community where users are getting rewarded for their voice, regardless of race, religion, gender or bias.

## How does Steemit differ from other social media sites?

Steemit differs entirely from social media giants like Facebook, Reddit and Twitter because it is public and decentralized. Entrepreneurs are beginning to build side apps off the Steem blockchain and we encourage it; through building our thriving community and enhancing the foundation of others, we are changing the way people use and think about the internet.

## Does it cost anything to post, comment, or vote?

It is free to post, comment, and upvote all content on Steemit.com. You might even get paid for it!

## Can I earn digital points on Steemit? How?

You can earn digital points on Steemit by:

Blogging/Posting - By sharing your original and unique posts, you can get upvotes by community members. Depending on the upvotes you receive, you will get a portion of that day’s total payout.

Curating/Voting - If you discover a post and upvote it before it becomes popular, you will receive a curation reward. The reward amount will depend on the amount you have vested, called Steem Power.

## Where does the value come from?

At its root, Steem is simply a points system similar to other arcade style points systems, however, because this points system is blockchain based, the points are traded on cryptocurrency markets. The speculation that occurs on these markets makes the value of the points transparent to everyone who uses Steem-based applications, such as Steemit.

Steem uses pre-determined mathematical formulas to determine how many new points it will issue to users each day, and the Steem network continually creates digital points to reward content creators and curators (for voting on blog posts) at this set and specific rate. Some of the newly-created points are transferred to users who add value to Steemit by blogging, commenting, and voting on other people's blog posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of Steem Power to protect them from dilution.

By analogy, Steem is a game system for content, where the rewards people earn are video game tokens that have real market value and are readily tradable for Bitcoin and USD. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a rare item by playing the game. If they have the scarce item, then they could potentially sell it on video game item markets.

## Why are my blogs posts not making much money?

Steemit is not a "get rich quick" scheme. While it is possible to post content that goes "viral" quickly and earn a lot of rewards on a single post, that is not the norm for most users. 

Most of the authors that you see earning high rewards are users that have spent a lot of time on the website building followings, making connections with other users through commenting, and developing a reputation for producing high quality content.

It is best not to focus on the rewards when you are first starting out, and work on building a following, making connections with other users, and developing a good reputation. If you consistantly do a good job with these things, then you will eventually get noticed by the larger stakeholders, and your rewards will likely increase.

# Community

## Is there an Etiquette Guide for Steemit?

https://steemit.com/steemit/@thecryptofiend/the-complete-steemit-etiquette-guide-revision-2-0

## What is verification?

Verfication is a process where you give evidence to show that you are the person that you claim to be.  This is to reduce fraud and people impersonating well known figures.

There are a number of ways of doing it. You can post a photo or a video which shows you holding up a sheet of paper with your handwritten user name on it. You can also verify by posting a link to your Steemit profile on a website which you are already known for running such as a blog, photography site etc.

## What are Whales, Dolphins and Minnows?

These are terms that people use to describe Steemit users with different amounts of Steem/SP.  There are no formal definitions.  As the names suggest whales have the largest amount of SP, followed by dolphins in the middle and minnows at the bottom. Where you set the boundaries for each is entirely subjective.  There is a lot of talk about whales because they have the largest voting power and influence on the platform.

Steemd uses a slightly different system which you can see here (https://steemd.com/distribution):

# Posting

## What can users upload to Steemit?

Steemit users can upload anything they want, whether it be phrases, quotes, anecdotes, photos, videos, memes, songs; anything that adds value to the ecosystem and generates commentary or critique.

## What are the different choices for post rewards (50/50, Power Up 100%, Decline Payout)?

- **50/50** - This will pay you in 50% Steem Power, and 50% liquid STEEM / SBD. The amount of liquid STEEM vs. SBD that you receive will be based on network conditions at the time of payout. This is the default payout option.

- **Power Up 100%** - This will pay you in 100% Steem Power.

- **Decline Payout** - You will receive no payouts for posts with "Decline Payout" selected.

Each time you create a new post, you must reselect your option if you do not want the default 50/50 payout option selected.

## Can I delete something I posted?

## What are tags?

Tags are a way to categorize your content, so that othe readers can find it. The more relevant tags used, the more like-minded readers will come across your post.

## What tags should I use?

Try to use tags that are relevant to your post, and that will be popular for other readers to browse. For example, "mytriptoalaska" may be relevant to your post, but readers are probably not going to go searching for that. "vacation" would be a better choice for a tag in this case.

You can browse through commonly used tags using the "Explore" link, in the main menu.

Be careful when choosing tags though. If your tags aren’t related to your post, you may get flagged for deceptive tagging.

All tags must be lowercase letters, and hyphenated words may include one dash.

## How many tags can I use?

You can choose up to 5 tags per post. 

## How do I format text in Markdown?

## How often can I post?

## How long can my post be?

Before posting, consider how much people are going to be willing to read at one time.

## How do I add pictures to my blog posts?

## How do I add videos to my blog posts?

https://steemit.com/steemitguide/@algimantas/detailed-guide-how-to-add-videos-in-steemit

## Is there a way I can make my images smaller?

The number one reason people won’t read your blog post is that it is taking too long to load. Therefore, it is important to make your photos a reasonable size. One way to do this is to upload your photos to imgur.com. When choosing the photo size click Huge Thumbnail. The photo will take up the entire screen, but it will still load quickly.

## What does "Promoting" a post do?

When you make a blog post, there is the option to promote it with Steem Dollars. It will then show up in the “Promoted” tab. The order it shows up depends on how much the post received. Posts with a higher promoted amount will show up first.

Steem Dollars spent to promote a post are paid to the account @null, which nobody owns or controls. Once a user transfers SD to @null, Steem removes them from the currency supply.
https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/introducing-promoted-content

You can promote your own posts, or posts that you like from from your friends or other users.

## How do I promote a post?

At the bottom of each post is a button to "Promote". After clicking the button, type he number of Steem Dollars you want to send and click “PROMOTE”. The operation will require your Active or Owner key.

This action cannot be undone!

# Comments

## Can I earn digital tokens for commenting?

Yes, comments that are upvoted can earn rewards just like blog posts!

## How often can I comment?

## When do I get paid?

## How many new tokens are generated by the blockchain?

## Why Do the Earnings for My Post Go Up/Down?

## What is the difference between STEEM, Steem Power, and Steem Dollars?

Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars are the three forms of digital points plugged into the Steem blockchain:

Steem - Steem is the most liquid form of currency in the platform. Steem can be converted into Steem Power, Steem Dollars, or traded. It is a cryptocurrency, similar to Bitcoin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).

Steem Power - Steem Power is a measurement of how much influence a user can wield via Steemit. The more Steem Power a user holds, the more they may influence the value of the content on the network. It is important to note when a user decides to “Power Down” Steem Power, they will receive equal distributions of the Steem Power as Steem over 13 weeks.

Steem Dollars - Steem Dollars are a blockchain and market powered token designed to be pegged to $1 USD. Steem Dollars may be turned into STEEM before they can be “Powered Up” into Steem Power. Steem Dollars may also be used to buy things in marketplaces, such as Steemit.com and PeerHub.com.

## Will 1 SBD always be worth $1 USD?

## Can I sell goods and services on Steemit?

You cannot sell items directly on Steemit.com, but you can list them on the third-party website https://www.peerhub.com/. You can accept payment in Steem Dollars or STEEM, and have the option to advertise your items through Steemit blog posts.

## What is Powering Down and Powering Up?

Powering Down - If you have Steem Power, you can begin to Power Down to obtain Steem. The system will transfer 1/13 of your Steem Power, to Steem each week for three months (13 weeks).

Powering Up - If you wish to gain more influence in the Steem network, you must increase your Steem Power. Powering Up is the process of instantaneously turning your Steem into Steem Power.

## What can I do with my SBD / STEEM tokens?

## What determines the price of STEEM?

Much like how the price of a stock goes up and down, the value of STEEM varies, determined by buyers and sellers on exchanges.

## Should I "Power Up" or withdraw my liquid earnings?

Everyone has different priorities. Some may want to power up to increase their voting influence and curation rewards. Others may want to cash out. It’s strictly a personal choice.

If you believe Steemit has the potential for significant growth, you might think it wise to power up. Not only will you immediately gain more influence in the network, but it also has the potential to increase in value.

## How do I get more Steem Power?

If you have Steem Dollars, you can convert them to STEEM from your wallet. Once you have STEEM in your wallet, click Power Up to turn it into Steem Power.

If you don’t already have STEEM or Steem Dollars in your wallet, you can purchase using Bitcoin (BTC) or another cryptocurrency. You may purchase BTC on various exchanges. A couple popular Bitcoin exchanges are Coinbase.com, and Localbitcoins.com. 

Once you have your bitcoin:
- Click “Buy Steem” from the main menu in the top right corner of Steemit.com.
- Seelct whether you want to buy STEEM or Steem Power.
- Send the amount you want to purchase to the wallet address on the screen.

You can also purchase STEEM and Steem Power using Bitshares or Ether using the steps above, by selecting the alternate currency from the dropdown on the "Buy Steem" page.

## What are Vests?

## How can I withdraw my STEEM or SBD coins?

There are several guides that have been posted by users in the community for using various exchanges to withdraw STEEM and SBD tokens. Please read the <a href="">disclaimer</a> before using any of these guides to withdraw your coins. The users, guides, and exchanges listed in the guides are not endorsed by Steemit, Inc. Use at your own risk. 

If you use any of these methods, it is recomended that you first try using a small amount to verify that it works before withdrawing a larger amount.

## Will I get a 1099 from Steemit?

No, you are not being paid by Steemit. The Steem network pays you. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you make, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. By creating an account, you agree that Steemit is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Steem transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Steem transactions.

## How much are the transaction fees for sending tokens between users?

There are never any fees for transfers within the Steem network. However, if you transfer Steem to an exchange and convert it to another currency, you will incur a small fee from the exchange.

## Are there fees for powering up, powering down, or converting SBD to STEEM?

No. None of these actions incur any fees. Also, trading STEEM for SBD or SBD for STEEM on the internal marketplace exchange does not have any fees either.

# Voting and Curating

## How do I upvote a post or comment?

To upvote a post or comment, click on the "upvote" icon at the bottom of the post/comment. (Insert Icon)

## What is my voting power?

This is like an "energy bar" in a computer game that gets depleted every time you vote.  You start off with 100%. Every time you vote, you use some of your power. IF you use up too much of your power, the value of your vote goes down. Think of it as a control measure to stop you up-voting everything you see.

## What is voting weight?

Users can chose to vote with less than 100% of their voting weight. Voting with less than 100% voting weight will use up less voting power, but it will also have less of an effect on the post rewards.

## How often can I vote without depleting my voting power?

You can use up to 40 100% weight votes within a 24 hour period without depleting your voting power.

## Where can I check my voting power?

You can view your current voting power using third party tools such as https://steemd.com/@youraccount or https://steemstats.com.

## Do both upvotes and downvotes use the same amount of voting power?

Yes.

## How do I vote with less than 100% voting weight?

New users can only upvote and downvote with 100% voting weight. Once you reach a certain amount of Steem Power, you will start to see a vote slider appear when you vote.

https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/28/Voting_slider8d9ba.png

You can use the slider to adjust the weight of your vote, between 1% and 100% voting weight.

## What determines how much of the curation reward goes to the author versus curators?

The rewards are allocated so that 75% of the payout goes to the author of the post/comment, and 25% goes to the curator. 

Of the 25% that goes to the curator though, that portion will be split between the author and the curator if the curator votes within the first 30 minutes. The split of the 25% between the author and curator during the first 30 minutes is calculated as a linear function based on the time the vote is cast.

- If a post is upvoted the moment of posting, 100% of the curation award goes to the author.
- At 3 minutes, 90% goes to the author and 10% to the curator.
- At 15 minutes it's a 50/50 split.
- At 27 minutes, 10% goes to the author and 90% to the curator.
- If a post is upvoted 30 min after posting, 100% of the curation award goes to the curator.

## Can I get curation rewards for voting up comments?

Yes. You can earn curation rewards from upvoting both posts and comments!

## What is the formula used to calculate curation rewards?

# Plagiarism, Spam, and Abuse

## What are Steemit’s policies on plagiarism and spam?

Plagiarized posts and spam are deemed as abuse and will be downvoted by community members. If you are posting or using someone else’s content, you must give them credit!

## Is it okay to use random pictures from the internet?

If you are using an image that is not your own, make sure you are allowed to use the image, and you cite the source of the image.

Using random pictures from the internet without giving credit is not allowed. You may, however, use photos from “free image” websites such as Pexels.com or Pixabay.com. At the time of the writing of this FAQ, all photos on Pexels and Pixabay are free for personal and commercial use and require no attribution.

Here is a post from @mindover that has links to many websites that have images you can use:
https://steemit.com/steem-help/@mindover/don-t-plagiarize-images-here-are-13-free-and-legal-ways-to-find-high-quality-photos-you-can-use-on-steemit

## What is SteemCleaners?

## Who is @cheetah?

@cheetah is a bot (developed by @anyx) that scours Steemit for copy/pasted content. Cheetah will not flag content immediately, but it alerts other users to look into it further.

The worst offenders (serial plagiarists or identity thieves, for example) will go on Cheetah’s blacklist. These users will get flagged by Cheetah when they post.

More information on the @cheetah bot can be found in this post:
https://steemit.com/steemitabuse/@cheetah/cheetah-bot-explained

## Where do I report a post or comment that contains plagiarism, spam, or abuse?

You can report any abusive content to the <a href="https://steemit.chat/channel/steemitabuse">steemitabuse</a> channel on steemit.chat.

# Downvoting

# Reputation

## What is Reputation?

Every user has a reputation score next to their name. The reputation score is one way Steemit measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. It is also a mechanism that is designed to help control abuse of the Steemit platform. 

Your reputation goes up when users with a higher reputation vote on your content. Getting flagged by someone with a higher reputation can push your repuation down and make your posts less visible.

Users with lower reputation are unable to affect your reputation.

## How is the Reputation score measured?

Every new user starts off with a figure of 25. The lowest possible reputation score is about -25 and the highest possible is 80.

The reputation score is based off of a `log10` system, which means that a score of 40 is about 10x better than a score of 30.

More information about the calculation of the reputation score can be found in this post from @digitalnotvir:
https://steemit.com/steemit/@digitalnotvir/how-reputation-scores-are-calculated-the-details-explained-with-simple-math

## How do I improve my reputation score?

Every time another user upvotes one of your posts or comments, it increases your reputation score. Users with a higher reputation than you will have more of a positive effect. Also, the more Steem Power that the voter has, the higher the effect as well. The best way to earn upvotes is by adding value to the Steemit community.

## What causes my reputation score to go down?

The only way for your reputation score to go down is to be downvoted by another user.

Not all downvotes will cause a reputation loss though.
- Downvotes from users with a lower reputation score than you will not hurt your score. 
- If your post or comment that was downvoted still received more upvotes than downvotes (measured in Steem Power vests), then the net effect on your reputation score will still be positive.

## Why does my reputation score matter?

A reputation score is one way Steemit measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. In real estate, they say there are three variables of the utmost importance: location, location, location. On Steemit, those things are: reputation, reputation, reputation. It’s not to say other variables aren’t important, but reputation will be an enormous factor in your level of success.

Many Steemians glance at users’ reputation scores when deciding which articles to read because they know higher reputation scores means it is much more likely quality original content. Furthermore, the higher your rep, the more effect your vote will have on the reputation of others.

It is worth noting that if your reputation goes below 0, Steemit will hide your posts and comments making it very difficult to gain monetary rewards and followers. This incentivises online etiquette and respect for your fellow Steemians.

# Followers, Feeds, and Resteem

## What is Resteeming?

This is like reblogging or sharing posts on other platforms.  Once your reblog a post it will appear in your feed to your followers as if you had posted it yourself.  Use it conservatively and with caution.  It is great to want to share content you like and appreciate with people you follow, but you don't want to annoy them by overdoing it.

## Can I share on other social media?

Yes you can use the share button to share on Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin. You are welcome to post your Steemit links on other websites and social media sites.

# Blockchain

## What is a blockchain?

## What is the Steem blockchain?

The Steem blockchain is an open source and publicly accessible database, that records all posts and votes, and distributes rewards across the network.

## What is the difference between Steem and Steemit?

Steem is the name of the blockchain that stores all of the data and transactions, and processes all of the events that take place. STEEM is also a name for the system’s value token (currency).

Steemit is simply an interface to interact with the blockchain, and view the blockchain data.

Daniel Larimer, CTO of Steemit, @dan @dantheman
https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-larimer-0a367089

## How does Steemit respond to public criticism?

Steemit is 100% committed to building the Steemit platform and contributing to Steem wherever possible. With new and disruptive technologies, critics are to be expected, but we believe the issue stems from lack of education. The Steemit founders openly address criticisms in several podcasts. In regards to founding ownership, Dan and Ned have sold a very small % of their holdings and the @steemit account only powers down to prepare for engagements that fund operations, marketing and development.
The Steemit founders respect people’s right to freedom of speech and their own opinions, but they encourage self-education and research on cutting edge concepts in decentralized social media.

## How does Steemit, Inc. earn money?

Over time, Steemit will allow advertisers and bloggers to promote content by buying and burning Steem. Steemit can benefit from sales of Steem to advertisers in the cryptocurrency markets or offer advanced services to these advertisers and bloggers.

## Can I invest in Steemit?

Steemit, Inc. is a privately held company and is not available for public investment.

You can invest in the platform though by purchasing STEEM tokens. These tokens have value based on the speculation that occurs on various exchanges. You can also power up these tokens into Steem Power, which gives you more influence in the platform as defined by the blockcain rules.

# Security

## What are my different keys for?

**Owner Key** - The owner key allows its user to post, vote, transfer funds, vote for witnesses, and change all keys including being able to alter the owner key. The owner key is only meant for use when necessary.The only thing the owner key can not do is decrypt private messages/memos sent to you, only the memo key can.

**Posting Key** - The posting key allows accounts to post, comment, vote, and follow other accounts. Most users should be logging into Steemit every day with the posting key, only using the active key when something to do with transferring funds or changing keys is necessary. You are more likely to have your password or key compromised the more you use it, so a limited posting key exists to restrict the damage that a compromised account key would cause.

**Active Key** - The active key can perform almost all functions for an account except change the owner key. It can change all other keys on an account, including the active key. The active key can do everything the post key can do, plus allows transferring, trading, powering up/powering down Steem Power, and voting for witnesses. It cannot decrypt private messages encrypted to your memo key.

**Memo Key** - The memo key is the only key that can decrypt private messages sent to your account. The Steemit team will implement this private message feature in the future.

## Are my Steem and Steem Dollar tokens insured in the event of a hack or if someone takes over my account?

No, it is not. If your money is in Steem Power, however, it is impossible for a hacker to take out more than 1/13 per week.

## How does the recovery process work?

In order to be able to recover a hacked account, you must first assign a trusted individual as your designated recovery account. This is someone who can identify you independently of your key. 

Steemit is the default recovery account for all users who sign up using Steemit.com. Steemit can identify users by their email, Facebook, and Reddit logins (if you signed up through us). You can also assign your mother, wife, employer, or friend, or another third party provider as your recover account if you prefer.

If your password has been changed without your concent, then the person you designated as you recovery account can allow you to generate a new set of keys (aka passwords) using any of the keys you have used in the past 30 days.

If you don't have a key used in the past 30 days, then your account will be unrecoverable.

## How can I keep my Steemit account secure?

Save your master key and keep it somewhere safe.

Only log into your account using the key with the appropriate permissions for what you are doing:
- Posting Key (Recommended, can be used to upvote/comment/post)
- Active Key (All permissions of posting key + Ability to transfer funds)
- Owner Key (Change the keys for your account)

Change your key frequently.

It is not recomended to share your keys with any third party site.

## Is it safe to use my account while on public wifi?

No, not without first taking additional steps. To prevent someone from hacking into your account while on a public wifi network, you should use a service like Private Tunnel VPN. Also, if you are only posting, commenting and voting, log in using your Posting Key.

## What should I do if I discover that someone hacked my account?

If you notice your account has been compromised, you should contact your account recovery partner (the trusted individual) and ask them to submit a request to change the locks on your account. They verify you by whatever means they find satisfactory and then submit a proposal to the blockchain to change the locks on your account.

Once they submit the proposal to the blockchain, you will have 24 hours to log in with both your old and new keys (aka passwords). Any key you used within the past 30 days is sufficient. If you login in time, then the keys will be changed, and the hacker will be locked out.

If you are using Steemit as your account recovery partner, there is a link to begin the process of account recovery in the main menu.

## What do I do if I lost my password/keys?

There is no way to recover your account if you lose your password / keys! It is **very important** that you save your keys somewhere safe where you will not lose them.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as a flash drive or burned CD, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

# Witnesses

## What are Steem witnesses?

The community also elected 'witnesses' to act as Steem’s governance body, making decisions on improving the platform and preventing early adopters who may attempt to make unfair financial gain.

The Steem blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof of Stake, or DPOS, in combination with Proof of Work. The people delegated to create these blocks are called witnesses and miners.

Steemit leverages Steem because the founders of Steemit believe Steem’s decentralized governance model makes Steem an excellent platform for supporting long term success of its social network and digital points.
