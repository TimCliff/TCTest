# General

## What is Steemit.com?

Steemit is a social network that empowers people for their contributions by rewarding them for their time, effort and creativity through digital points called Steem.

Steemit has redefined social media by building a living, breathing, growing social economy; a “small town” community where users are getting rewarded for their voice, regardless of race, religion, gender or bias.

## How does Steemit differ from other social media sites?

Steemit differs entirely from social media giants like Facebook, Reddit and Twitter because it is public and decentralized. Entrepreneurs are beginning to build side apps off the Steem blockchain and we encourage it; through building our thriving community and enhancing the foundation of others, we are changing the way people use and think about the internet.

## Does it cost anything to post, comment, or vote?

## Can I earn digital points on Steemit? How?

You can earn digital points on Steemit by:

Blogging/Posting - By sharing your original and unique posts, you can get upvotes by community members. Depending on the upvotes you receive, you will get a portion of that day’s total payout.

Curating/Voting - If you discover a post and upvote it before it becomes popular, you will receive a curation reward. The reward amount will depend on the amount you have vested, called Steem Power.

## Where does the value come from?

At its root, Steem is simply a points system similar to other arcade style points systems, however, because this points system is blockchain based, the points are traded on cryptocurrency markets. The speculation that occurs on these markets makes the value of the points transparent to everyone who uses Steem-based applications, such as Steemit.

Steem uses pre-determined mathematical formulas to determine how many new points it will issue to users each day, and the Steem network continually creates digital points to reward content creators and curators (for voting on blog posts) at this set and specific rate. Some of the newly-created points are transferred to users who add value to Steemit by blogging, commenting, and voting on other people's blog posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of Steem Power to protect them from dilution.

By analogy, Steem is a game system for content, where the rewards people earn are video game tokens that have real market value and are readily tradable for Bitcoin and USD. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a rare item by playing the game. If they have the scarce item, then they could potentially sell it on video game item markets.

## What is verification?

Verfication is a process where you give evidence to show that you are the person that you claim to be.  This is to reduce fraud and people impersonating well known figures.

There are a number of ways of doing it. You can post a photo or a video which shows you holding up a sheet of paper with your handwritten user name on it. You can also verify by posting a link to your Steemit profile on a website which you are already known for running such as a blog, photography site etc.

## What are Whales, Dolphins and Minnows?

These are terms that people use to describe Steemit users with different amounts of Steem/SP.  There are no formal definitions.  As the names suggest whales have the largest amount of SP, followed by dolphins in the middle and minnows at the bottom. Where you set the boundaries for each is entirely subjective.  There is a lot of talk about whales because they have the largest voting power and influence on the platform.

Steemd uses a slightly different system which you can see here (https://steemd.com/distribution):

## What is the difference between STEEM, Steem Power, and Steem Dollars?

Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars are the three forms of digital points plugged into the Steem blockchain:

Steem - Steem is the most liquid form of currency in the platform. Steem can be converted into Steem Power, Steem Dollars, or traded. It is a cryptocurrency, similar to Bitcoin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).

Steem Power - Steem Power is a measurement of how much influence a user can wield via Steemit. The more Steem Power a user holds, the more they may influence the value of the content on the network. It is important to note when a user decides to “Power Down” Steem Power, they will receive equal distributions of the Steem Power as Steem over 13 weeks.

Steem Dollars - Steem Dollars are a blockchain and market powered token designed to be pegged to $1 USD. Steem Dollars may be turned into STEEM before they can be “Powered Up” into Steem Power. Steem Dollars may also be used to buy things in marketplaces, such as Steemit.com and PeerHub.com.

## What is Powering Down and Powering Up?

Powering Down - If you have Steem Power, you can begin to Power Down to obtain Steem. The system will transfer 1/13 of your Steem Power, to Steem each week for three months (13 weeks).

Powering Up - If you wish to gain more influence in the Steem network, you must increase your Steem Power. Powering Up is the process of instantaneously turning your Steem into Steem Power.

## Will I get a 1099 from Steemit?

No, you are not being paid by Steemit. The Steem network pays you. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you make, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. By creating an account, you agree that Steemit is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Steem transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Steem transactions.

# Voting and Curating

## What is my voting power?

This is like an "energy bar" in a computer game that gets depleted every time you vote.  You start off with 100%. Every time you vote, you use some of your power. IF you use up too much of your power, the value of your vote goes down. Think of it as a control measure to stop you up-voting everything you see.

## What is voting weight?

Users can chose to vote with less than 100% of their voting weight. Voting with less than 100% voting weight will use up less voting power, but it will also have less of an effect on the post rewards.

## How often can I vote without depleting my voting power?

You can use up to 40 100% weight votes within a 24 hour period without depleting your voting power.

## Where can I check my voting power?

You can view your current voting power using third party tools such as https://steemd.com/@youraccount or https://steemstats.com.

## Do both upvotes and downvotes use the same amount of voting power?

Yes.

## How do I vote with less than 100% voting weight?

New users can only upvote and downvote with 100% voting weight. Once you reach a certain amount of Steem Power, you will start to see a vote slider appear when you vote.

https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/28/Voting_slider8d9ba.png

You can use the slider to adjust the weight of your vote, between 1% and 100% voting weight.

## Curation Rewards

# Plagiarism/Spam/Abuse

# Downvoting

# Reputation

## What is Reputation?

Every user has a reputation score next to their name. This is a mechanism that is designed to help control abuse of the Steemit platform. Every new user starts off with a figure of 25. The maximum is 100.

Your reputation goes up when users with a higher reputation vote on your content. Getting flagged by someone with a higher reputation can push your repuation down and make your posts less visible.

Users with lower reputation are unable to affect your reputation.

# Followers, Feeds, and Resteem

## What is Resteeming?

This is like reblogging or sharing posts on other platforms.  Once your reblog a post it will appear in your feed to your followers as if you had posted it yourself.  Use it conservatively and with caution.  It is great to want to share content you like and appreciate with people you follow, but you don't want to annoy them by overdoing it.

## Can I share on other social media?

Yes you can use the share button to share on Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin. You are welcome to post your Steemit links on other websites and social media sites.

# Steemit, Inc.

## Who are the Steemit co-founders?

Ned Scott, CEO of Steemit, @ned

Daniel Larimer, CTO of Steemit, @dan @dantheman

## How does Steemit respond to public criticism?

Steemit is 100% committed to building the Steemit platform and contributing to Steem wherever possible. With new and disruptive technologies, critics are to be expected, but we believe the issue stems from lack of education. The Steemit founders openly address criticisms in several podcasts. In regards to founding ownership, Dan and Ned have sold a very small % of their holdings and the @steemit account only powers down to prepare for engagements that fund operations, marketing and development.
The Steemit founders respect people’s right to freedom of speech and their own opinions, but they encourage self-education and research on cutting edge concepts in decentralized social media.

## How does Steemit, Inc. earn money?

Over time, Steemit will allow advertisers and bloggers to promote content by buying and burning Steem. Steemit can benefit from sales of Steem to advertisers in the cryptocurrency markets or offer advanced services to these advertisers and bloggers.

# Security

## Are my Steem and Steem Dollar tokens insured in the event of a hack or if someone takes over my account?

No, it is not. If your money is in Steem Power, however, it is impossible for a hacker to take out more than 1/13 per week.

## How does the recovery process work?

In order to be able to recover a hacked account, you must first assign a trusted individual as your designated recovery account. This is someone who can identify you independently of your key. 

Steemit is the default recovery account for all users who sign up using Steemit.com. Steemit can identify users by their email, Facebook, and Reddit logins (if you signed up through us). You can also assign your mother, wife, employer, or friend, or another third party provider as your recover account if you prefer.

If your password has been changed without your concent, then the person you designated as you recovery account can allow you to generate a new set of keys (aka passwords) using any of the keys you have used in the past 30 days.

If you don't have a key used in the past 30 days, then your account will be unrecoverable.

## What should I do if I discover that someone hacked my account?

If you notice your account has been compromised, you should contact your account recovery partner (the trusted individual) and ask them to submit a request to change the locks on your account. They verify you by whatever means they find satisfactory and then submit a proposal to the blockchain to change the locks on your account.

Once they submit the proposal to the blockchain, you will have 24 hours to log in with both your old and new keys (aka passwords). Any key you used within the past 30 days is sufficient. If you login in time, then the keys will be changed, and the hacker will be locked out.

## What do I do if I lost my password/keys?

There is no way to recover your account if you lose your password / keys! It is **very important** that you save your keys somewhere safe where you will not lose them.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as a flash drive or burned CD, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

## How do I report a security vulnerability?

If you find a security issue please report details to security@steemit.com.

# Blockchain

## What is the difference between POW and DPOS?

# Witnesses

## What are Steem witnesses?

The community also elected 'witnesses' to act as Steem’s governance body, making decisions on improving the platform and preventing early adopters who may attempt to make unfair financial gain.

The Steem blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof of Stake, or DPOS, in combination with Proof of Work. The people delegated to create these blocks are called witnesses and miners.

Steemit leverages Steem because the founders of Steemit believe Steem’s decentralized governance model makes Steem an excellent platform for supporting long term success of its social network and digital points.
