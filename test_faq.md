## What is Steemit.com?

Steemit is a social network that empowers people for their contributions by rewarding them for their time, effort and creativity through digital points called Steem.

Steemit has redefined social media by building a living, breathing, growing social economy; a “small town” community where users are getting rewarded for their voice, regardless of race, religion, gender or bias.

## How does Steemit differ from other social media sites?

Steemit differs entirely from social media giants like Facebook, Reddit and Twitter because it is public and decentralized. Entrepreneurs are beginning to build side apps off the Steem blockchain and we encourage it; through building our thriving community and enhancing the foundation of others, we are changing the way people use and think about the internet.

## Does it cost anything to post, comment, or vote?

## Where does the value come from?

At its root, Steem is simply a points system similar to other arcade style points systems, however, because this points system is blockchain based, the points are traded on cryptocurrency markets. The speculation that occurs on these markets makes the value of the points transparent to everyone who uses Steem-based applications, such as Steemit.

Steem uses pre-determined mathematical formulas to determine how many new points it will issue to users each day, and the Steem network continually creates digital points to reward content creators and curators (for voting on blog posts) at this set and specific rate. Some of the newly-created points are transferred to users who add value to Steemit by blogging, commenting, and voting on other people's blog posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of Steem Power to protect them from dilution.

By analogy, Steem is a game system for content, where the rewards people earn are video game tokens that have real market value and are readily tradable for Bitcoin and USD. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a rare item by playing the game. If they have the scarce item, then they could potentially sell it on video game item markets.

## What are Whales, Dolphins and Minnows?

These are terms that people use to describe Steemit users with different amounts of Steem/SP.  There are no formal definitions.  As the names suggest whales have the largest amount of SP, followed by dolphins in the middle and minnows at the bottom. Where you set the boundaries for each is entirely subjective.  There is a lot of talk about whales because they have the largest voting power and influence on the platform.

Steemd uses a slightly different system which you can see here (https://steemd.com/distribution):

## What is the difference between STEEM, Steem Power, and Steem Dollars?

Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars are the three forms of digital points plugged into the Steem blockchain:

Steem - Steem is the most liquid form of currency in the platform. Steem can be converted into Steem Power, Steem Dollars, or traded. It is a cryptocurrency, similar to Bitcoin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).

Steem Power - Steem Power is a measurement of how much influence a user can wield via Steemit. The more Steem Power a user holds, the more they may influence the value of the content on the network. It is important to note when a user decides to “Power Down” Steem Power, they will receive equal distributions of the Steem Power as Steem over 13 weeks.

Steem Dollars - Steem Dollars are a blockchain and market powered token designed to be pegged to $1 USD. Steem Dollars may be turned into STEEM before they can be “Powered Up” into Steem Power. Steem Dollars may also be used to buy things in marketplaces, such as Steemit.com and PeerHub.com.

## What is Powering Down and Powering Up?

Powering Down - If you have Steem Power, you can begin to Power Down to obtain Steem. The system will transfer 1/13 of your Steem Power, to Steem each week for three months (13 weeks).

Powering Up - If you wish to gain more influence in the Steem network, you must increase your Steem Power. Powering Up is the process of instantaneously turning your Steem into Steem Power.

## Will I get a 1099 from Steemit?

No, you are not being paid by Steemit. The Steem network pays you. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you make, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. By creating an account, you agree that Steemit is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Steem transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Steem transactions.

## How does Steemit respond to public criticism?

Steemit is 100% committed to building the Steemit platform and contributing to Steem wherever possible. With new and disruptive technologies, critics are to be expected, but we believe the issue stems from lack of education. The Steemit founders openly address criticisms in several podcasts. In regards to founding ownership, Dan and Ned have sold a very small % of their holdings and the @steemit account only powers down to prepare for engagements that fund operations, marketing and development.
The Steemit founders respect people’s right to freedom of speech and their own opinions, but they encourage self-education and research on cutting edge concepts in decentralized social media.

# Security

## Are my Steem and Steem Dollar tokens insured in the event of a hack or if someone takes over my account?

No, it is not. If your money is in Steem Power, however, it is impossible for a hacker to take out more than 1/13 per week.

## How do I report a security vulnerability?

If you find a security issue please report details to security@steemit.com.

# Witnesses

## What are Steem witnesses?

The community also elected 'witnesses' to act as Steem’s governance body, making decisions on improving the platform and preventing early adopters who may attempt to make unfair financial gain.

The Steem blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof of Stake, or DPOS, in combination with Proof of Work. The people delegated to create these blocks are called witnesses and miners.

Steemit leverages Steem because the founders of Steemit believe Steem’s decentralized governance model makes Steem an excellent platform for supporting long term success of its social network and digital points.
